            <p>
                Hello, my name is Mike, I have a strong desire to learn, grow, and design wonderful
                websites.  I remember first diving into the world of web development in the late 90's in highschool.
                And dipping my toes into the world of HTML.
            </p>
            <p>  I left the studying of web design behind when I went to college.  My first job out of college introduced me to the
                world of mySQL.  While I only did simple and basic queries it was still fascniating.
                I decided to re-introduce myself to web design and development by completing a Full Stack
                Developer Bootcamp.  This opened my eyes to the wonderful technology that has been implmented in
                the years since I last created my first H1 tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope to take the knowledge I gained and grow even further in a career that lets me create
                projects that can be enjoyed by all.
            </p>
